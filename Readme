Wave Maker instrument for emriver models, fits Em2, Em3, Em4 or can be custom made to length for custom sized stream tables.
The Wave Maker controller drives a stepper motor to precisely control the movement of a paddle to displace water and create waves.
The timing pulley has two magnets and the device has hall effect sensors to detect those magnets, they're used for positioning.
The Wave Maker is the only controller to utilize both 328p microcontrollers on the Big Muddy Control Board.
The secondary processor is constantly sending microsteps to the stepper motor, and most any interrupt becomes noticeable.
The primary processor scans for user input on the optical encoder, drives the LCD, does most of the math, and periodically sends paramater changes to the secondary via I2C.
The user is able to adjust time in seconds to wait between each wave, paddle speed in the form of a percent, and travel range in degrees.
As the user updates these parameters, the device measures time between start and stop of the wave to calculate and report back waves per minute.
The instrument also has a tsunami mode, featuring a more powerful wave than any of the automatic settings, and each wave is sent manually by clicking the encoder button.
The paddle accelerates and decelerates at the start/stop of each movement to prevent damage or excessive splashing.
The paddle homes to the central position upon power up.
